      K-12 students experienced a monumental shift in their education starting March 15, 2020 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html#:~:text=March%2015%2C%202020,the%20spread%20of%20COVID%2D19">when states began enacting shutdowns</a> due to the pandemic. Schools closed their doors and students of all grade levels switched to learning over Zoom and other online platforms. 
  </p>
  <p>
      Now over three and a half years later, students are experiencing a learning gap in content as well as the ways they interact with each other and process information. According to data from the <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/news/23/05/new-data-show-how-pandemic-affected-learning-across-whole-communities#:~:text=Living%20in%20a%20community%20where,of%20a%20year%20in%20reading.">Harvard Graduate School of Education</a>, “The average U.S. public school student in grades 3-8 lost the equivalent of a half year of learning in math and a quarter of a year in reading.”

  <p>  Many teachers and administrators are working to provide students with the tools they need to return to grade level, but with lower attention spans and limited resources, their efforts have extensive limitations.</p>

<h2>Learning how to communicate with others and increasing reading literacy are among the chief challenges of bridging the gap. </h2>

    <p>Julia Ferre – an eighth grade teacher at SkyView Academy in Highlands Ranch, Colorado – was teaching fifth graders when the pandemic closed down her classroom. Now, she is instructing the same group of students again as eighth graders and said she noticed a concerning gap in the way they process information. </p>

    <p>“When we first got back, there was a lot of uncertainty or even just a lack of exposure [for students] on how do I engage in conversations?” she said. “How do I start a conversation? How do I participate in a group discussion? And when you think about what education really is, which is an exchange of ideas, that was really difficult.” </p>
    <p>Ferre explained that being a “good teacher” means listening to your students’ ideas for as long as you lecture, if not longer. However, when students returned back to the physical classroom, they were nervous and quiet – they didn’t know how to collaborate or share their own thoughts. </p>
    <p>In terms of quantifiable data, she said students’ class test scores are lower even though they have been taught the same lesson plans as previous years. </p>

    <p> However, state testing success does not encapsulate the whole picture. Ferre is more concerned about her students’ “diminished stamina” and inability to focus for long periods of time. </p>
  <p>Ella MacLeod – assistant principal and reading specialist at Lincoln Elementary School in Winchester, Massachusetts – also noticed a decrease in stamina from her school’s third, fourth, and fifth grade students. An article from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/07/children-attention-span-shorter-covid-crisis-teachers-england-primary#:~:text=The%20survey%20of%20504%20primary,increase%20in%20inattention%20and%20daydreaming.">The Guardian</a> cited a survey of 504 teachers where 84% agreed children had shorter attention spans than ever before post-pandemic. </p>
  <p>“They missed so many of those foundational skills of how to be a student that we have to be more explicit in our teaching of speaking and listening skills and different aspects of how you need to behave in order to be a good student and to retain information,” said MacLeod. Ferre is also worried about her students’ lack of reading literacy. </p>
  <p><a href="https://pirls2021.org/frameworks/home/reading-assessment-framework/a-definition-of-reading-literacy/index.html#:~:text=Reading%20literacy%20is%20the%20ability,everyday%20life%2C%20and%20for%20enjoyment.">Reading literacy</a> is the ability to understand texts in a variety of forms – including written materials such as newspapers, which she said students weren’t often interacting with at home. </p>
  </article>

  <div class="quote" id="Quote_container_1"> 
    <p>  “What we're really seeing is literacy skills that you would expect kindergarteners and first graders to have learned, and they now don't have in eighth grade,” said Ferre. “Things like how does a book work? Do I read from left to right? Do I assemble papers in numeric or chronological order? Do I staple in the top left corner? [They are] not really getting how text is assembled.”</p>
  </div>
</section>

<text>
  <h2>At SkyView Academy, Ferre said increasing literacy is one of their primary goals. </h2>
  <p>  “We are trying to [introduce] more and more words, and using best practice tools that were formerly used only for English language learners to introduce new vocabulary [and] help students understand how to use things in context,” she said. “We're using a lot of illustrations to help students who don’t even have the handwriting and letter formation capabilities of eighth graders to actually write out what they're thinking.”</p>
  <p>  <a href="https://www.eschoolnews.com/innovative-teaching/2022/12/09/foundational-literacy-is-key-to-reversing-post-covid-reading-declines/">E School News</a> discusses the importance of building literacy through science-based courses to get students back on track. Ferre said the school is doing just that. SkyView Academy is also integrating more vocabulary building exercises in math classes and using tools like math clock manipulatives often utilized by lower grade levels. </p>
  <p>  Improving literacy also means having subject matter conversations outside of the classroom, said Ferre. She explained that many students who are still on track have highly educated parents who have discussions with their students about what they are learning.   </p>
  <p>  Meaningful conversations incorporating vocabulary used at school helps students cement their learning, but she acknowledged that not everyone has the time, resources, and education to have those conversations with their children. </p>

<h2>Lincoln Elementary School is focusing on reteaching their third, fourth, and fifth grade students how to interact with each other.</h2>
<section>
  <div class="quote" id="Quote_container_2"> 
    <p>  “We've talked a lot about going back to the basics and reteaching those foundational skills of what do you need to do in order to listen and what do good listeners look like? How do you have a good conversation? How do you know that someone is listening to you?” said MacLeod.</p>

  <p>  In <a href="https://www.k12dive.com/news/5-strategies-for-rebuilding-student-engagement-after-covid-19/630143/">an article for K-12 Dive</a>, former superintendent of Pittsburgh Public Schools Anthony Hamlet suggested reengaging students by encouraging collaboration, so students can relearn how to work together and problem solve. </p>
  <p>  With weakened attention spans, Lincoln Elementary School is also teaching students how to deal with zoning out in class: apologize and ask the teacher to please repeat or clarify what they said. </p>

  <h2>Caregivers are an integral part of reinforcing learning. </h2>
<text>   Teachers can try their best to help students during school hours, but they also need support from parents to continue bridging the gap, said Ferre.
  “I see my biggest challenge of overcoming any gap like this is a trust or an acknowledgement of expertise in communities and in homes about schools,” she said.
  Oftentimes when she suggests a plan for how a family can help with their child’s learning, they ignore or argue with her.

    <p>  “We're on the same page,” she said. “We both love their child desperately, but they've lost sight of the expertise of education as an industry.”
    </p>

    According to Positive Action, parent involvement in students’ learning inspires students to want to learn, and therefore, earn higher grades. It also causes students to be more respectful toward their teachers and peers.

  <h2>
    MacLeod pointed to a lack of funding as Lincoln Elementary School’s biggest hurdle to success.
  </h2>
  <text>
      “There's a lot more kids who are qualifying for special education, and it's hard to determine if they're qualified because there's a gap in learning or if it's a result of having a special learning disability,” said MacLeod. “We need so many more special ed teachers.”

    <h2>Steps initially taken to give students a break during the lockdown might be hurting them now.</h2>
  <p>An initiative proposed to help students became a learning barrier at Winchester High School in Winchester, Massachusetts, according to Spanish teacher Betsy Jackson. </p>
  <p>Jackson explained that many students at the high school take on multiple AP and honors courses and challenge themselves in their learning paths. However, during COVID, administration removed midterm and final exams, and the high school still has not returned to pre-pandemic testing. </p>
  <p>“​​Now we have this weak, mid-year exam optional activity where teachers are given the option to [require] something, but it can't be that long, so it's not truly a midterm exam,” she said. “Kids are getting to college now without having had to prep and study and synthesize large amounts of material.”</p>
  <p>Stronger test performance is still often a link to success in college and work, according to the <a href="https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/do-tests-predict-later-success#:~:text=So%2C%20do%20test%20scores%20predict,student%20outcomes%20after%20high%20school.">Thomas B.

  <h2>The introduction of AI technology may decrease students’ ability to learn.</h2>
  <p>Jackson is also worried about the introduction of AI technology post-pandemic. As a Spanish teacher, it was easier to tell when students cheated using Google translate because the translations were often incorrect. AI is better at providing error-free answers, making it more difficult for her to detect cheating.</p>
  <p>She is also concerned about the further integration of technology in classroom settings since the pandemic. Students at the high school bring in their own devices or use a Chromebook provided by the school, but there is no way for teachers to monitor what students are actually using them for. Students could be working on their assignments or online shopping, and she wouldn’t be able to tell the difference unless she was actively watching their screens. </p>
  <p>Jackson said she isn’t sure online assignments are beneficial for students to actually retain information. Her daughter has to fill out Google forms for her history class, but can search for the answers in her online textbook and complete the form without actually reading the information. </p>
  <p>Whenever possible, Jackson introduces pencil and paper assignments with physical dictionaries in her Spanish classes, so students have to work out the answers on their own. </p>
